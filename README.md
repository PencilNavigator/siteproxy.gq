# ANNOUNCEMENT
The domain "siteproxy.gq" has been taken back by registar `**freenom**`, without any notice and emails. Currently, the domain itself is `**down**` and unusable.
Currently, i am fixing this problem by trying to reach out for freenom, or consider buying a new domain for this free public service.
For now, please consider using other free online site proxy services such as [https://cors.eu.org](\https://cors.eu.org/https://bing.com).
